# About

This template is made using **Reactjs** with **Bootstrap**, allowing you to get started with building responsive cover page for your website with ease.

The directory structure of the project, and splitting of the code into components & modules makes
this template scalable & manageable. But feel free to experiment and change it according to your needs 😄

# Getting started

Just follow the steps below to get started. 📓

1. Fork the repo by clicking the fork button.
2. The above command will create a separate copy of the repo
3. Then clone the repo so that it is available locally
4. Run **`npm install`** after moving to the root of the dir
5. User **`npm start`** to run the React app

# Usage

Although the project is pretty straightforward, you can customize it and add newer dependencies as
per your needs. Here is some brief info about the dir structure.

### 1) **`pages`**  📂
Here, you can add other pages as per you needs, like if you want to have a separate Login/signup page, Carrers page, About us page etc. This is the dir you need to add to.

### 2) **`modules`**  📂
This dir holds the various sections of the page you are going to include in the pages section. Like, I currently, it contains only modules/sections utilized in the Landing page

### 3) **`components`**  📂
In this dir, you need to add all the dumb/reusable components which can be used across various pages or modules.

### 4) **`data`**  📂
I set up this dir in order for any data you want to use to populate various sections of your page. Create a **`.json`** file for that data and utilize it within your pages/modules.

## **_ The App.js dir contains all the routes that needs to be set up for various pages _**
