![react-template](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40212568/136203625-519c08ef-4319-4bd6-8cbd-441f33bdabcf.gif)

This template is made using **Reactjs** with **Bootstrap**, allowing you to get started with building responsive cover page for your website with ease.

The directory strucutre of the project, and splitting of the code into components & modules makes
this template scalable & manageable.

### Don't just fork the repo , do leave a :star:

# Getting started

Just follow the steps below to get started.

1. Fork the repo by clicking the fork button.
2. The above command will create a separate copy of the repo
3. Then clone the repo so that it is available locally
4. Run **`npm install`** after moving to the root of the dir
5. User **`npm start`** to run the React app

# Usage

Although the project is pretty straightforward, you can customize it and add newer dependencies as
per your needs. Let me brief you about the dir structure.

1. **`pages`** : Here, you can add other pages as per you needs, like if you want to have a separate Login/signup page, Carrers page, About us page etc. This is the dir you need to add to.

2. **`modules`** : This dir holds the various sections of the page you are going to include in the pages section. Like, I currently, it contains only modules/sections utilized in the Landing page

3. **`components`** : In this dir, you need to add all the dumb/reusable components which can be used across various pages or modules.

4. **`data`** : I set up this dir in order for any data you want to use to populate various sections of your page. You can create a `.json` file for that data and utilize it within your pages/modules.

**_ The App.js dir contains all the routes that needs to be set up for various pages _**
